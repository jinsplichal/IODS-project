# Writing something about the course
I look forward to improving my skills for writing R and to learning statistics and GitHub. I am also excited about writing R in Rmd format. I've been using *jupyter notebook* to write both Python and R (limited experiences), but I am interested in comparing the pros and cons of both methods.
