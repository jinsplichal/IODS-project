# Writing something about the course

I look forward to improving my skills for writing R and to learning
statistics and GitHub. I am also excited about writing R in Rmd format.
Iâ€™ve been using *jupyter notebook* to write both Python and R (limited
experiences), but I am interested in comparing the pros and cons of both
methods.
