# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your github repository here. This is an R markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R markdown syntax. See the 'Useful links' page in the mooc area (chapter 1) for instructions.*

I look forward to improving my skills for writing R and to learning statistics and GitHub. I am also excited about writing R in Rmd format. I've been using *jupyter notebook* to write both Python and R (limited experiences), but I am interested in comparing the pros and cons of both methods.
